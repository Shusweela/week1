Its beeen funny that I never could decide what my favorite color is until after growing up.  You don't have to stick with black, blue, orange, yellow, etc. ...and now that they have it in stores...I have not bought much of the color yet! lol :joy:


**Other Colors like**...
```
peach
coral
cotton candy
rose gold
yellow, green, orange, blue etc..
I"m girlier than I thought...pink was my least favorite as a little girl...but iridescent is probably girlier. ha
